The Welch Two Sample t-test testing the difference between mg2$control and mg2$Mg2 (mean of x = 15.68, mean
of y = 10.52) suggests that the effect is positive, statistically significant, and large (difference = 5.16,
95% CI [3.83, 6.49], t(17.35) = 8.15, p < .001; Cohen's d = 3.65, 95% CI [2.14, 5.12])
